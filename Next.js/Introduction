What is Next.js?
Next.js is a React framework that helps build fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable web applications. It extends React by adding powerful features like:

File-based routing (No need for React Router)
Server-side rendering (SSR) and Static site generation (SSG) for better performance
API Routes (You can create backend endpoints within the same project)
Automatic code-splitting (Loads only what’s needed for better performance)
Image Optimization (Built-in support for serving optimized images)
Middleware for request handling
Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) (Updates static pages without rebuilding the whole site)
Why Use Next.js Over React?
React alone: React is great for building UI, but it lacks routing, SSR, and other optimizations. You have to manually set up tools like React Router, Express.js, and SSR solutions.

Next.js: It provides everything out of the box for better performance, SEO, and DX (Developer Experience).

✅ Use Next.js when you need SEO, faster loading, or a mix of SSR, SSG, and CSR.
❌ Use React when you’re building small SPAs (Single Page Applications) where SEO doesn’t matter.
