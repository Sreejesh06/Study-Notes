# **What is Next.js?**  
Next.js is a **React framework** that makes it easier to build **fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly** web applications.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Why do we need Next.js?**  
While React is great for building **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**, it has some limitations when it comes to:  
- **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** â€“ React apps are rendered on the client-side (CSR), which means search engines struggle to index them.  
- **Performance Issues** â€“ Loading everything on the client leads to slower initial page loads.  
- **Backend Integration** â€“ You need an external server like Express.js to handle API requests.  

**Next.js solves these problems by:** 

âœ… Supporting **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** & **Static Site Generation (SSG)**.  
âœ… Enabling **automatic code splitting** for better performance.  
âœ… Allowing **backend functionality** with API routes.  
âœ… Providing built-in **image optimization, internationalization, and middleware**.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Real-World Example:**  
Imagine you're building an **e-commerce website** where:  
- The homepage should load **fast** (use **Static Site Generation - SSG**).  
- The product details page should fetch real-time stock availability (use **Server-Side Rendering - SSR**).  
- A dashboard should be **protected and require authentication** (use **middleware**).  

Next.js allows you to handle **all these cases efficiently** in one framework.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Interview Question:**  
ðŸ’¡ *What are the key differences between Next.js and React?*  

| Feature | React | Next.js |  
|---------|-------|---------|  
| **Rendering** | Client-Side Only (CSR) | CSR, SSR, SSG, ISR |  
| **Routing** | Requires React Router | Built-in File-based Routing |  
| **SEO** | Poor SEO (CSR) | Excellent SEO (SSR/SSG) |  
| **API Handling** | Needs Express.js or Firebase | Built-in API Routes |  
| **Performance** | Manual Optimization | Automatic Code Splitting |  

âœ… **Best Answer:** *Next.js extends React by adding SSR, SSG, file-based routing, and API routes, making it more suitable for SEO-friendly and performant applications.*
