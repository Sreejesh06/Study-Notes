Next.js Full Guide: From Basics to Advanced

What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that helps build fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable web applications. It extends React by adding powerful features like:

File-based routing (No need for React Router)

Server-side rendering (SSR) and Static site generation (SSG)

API Routes (Create backend endpoints within the same project)

Automatic code-splitting

Image Optimization

Middleware for request handling

Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) (Updates static pages without full rebuilds)
