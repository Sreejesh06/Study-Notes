# Interpreter vs Compiler

## 1. Introduction
Both **interpreters** and **compilers** are used to convert high-level programming languages (like Python, C, Java) into machine code that computers can understand.

## 2. Interpreter
- Translates and executes code **line by line**.
- Stops execution if an error is found.
- Slower execution due to repeated translation.
- Example languages: **Python, JavaScript, Ruby**.

## 3. Compiler
- Translates the entire code **at once** into machine code.
- Displays all errors after compilation.
- Faster execution since translation happens only once.
- Example languages: **C, C++, Java**.

## 4. Key Differences

| Feature         | Interpreter | Compiler |
|---------------|-----------|---------|
| Execution     | Line by line | Whole code at once |
| Speed        | Slower | Faster |
| Error Handling | Stops at first error | Shows all errors after compilation |
| Example Languages | Python, JavaScript | C, C++, Java |
