# Stack - Basics

## What is a Stack?

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle.

- The last element added is the first one to be removed.
- Example: A stack of plates, where the plate placed last is removed first.

## Key Operations

1. **Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop:** Removes the top element.
3. **Peek/Top:** Returns the top element without removing it.
4. **isEmpty:** Checks if the stack is empty.
5. **Size:** Returns the number of elements in the stack.
